         <ol>
        <li>Place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. 
            Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water.
             Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,  and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
            Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of marinara sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan.
                Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                Top with ¼ of the mozzarella cheese. 
                Top with 1/3 of the pepperoni slices, 1/3 of the mushrooms,
                 1/3 of the olives, and 1/3 of the green peppers. 
                 Spoon about 1 cup marinara sauce over the toppings, then sprinkle with ¼ cup parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers.
                To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of marinara sauce to cover the pasta.
                 Top with remaining mozzarella, toppings, and Parmesan cheese. 
            </li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes. Serve hot. </li>
